Â© MAG 2020   MYCRAFT This game is a copy of the popular minecraft game (2009). But I did it.   --------Control-------------- F4 is a network game, here's how to use it:    -to play on a local network: write localhost, in the same way on the second device. On the device from which the stream is flowing - create a server, this is done like this:     write localhost     -after this you will be asked the question: do you want to create     server? Your answer should be YES. (there is no need to create a server on the second device)  -After the server is created, take a look at the game, it will happen automatically, you just have to wait from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, if you wait longer, then obviously something is wrong  F3 - change the game mode (flight / normal)  Management - by arrows.  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------     Work mail: artykommer@gmail.com  Discord: MrBLOKOVICH # 7309  Youtube channel: MrBLOKOVICH      VERSION: a001 (alpha 0.0.1)  Download update:
